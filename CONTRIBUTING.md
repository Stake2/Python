Contribute to the project by looking, analyzing, and running the Python files, understanding how the modules work.<br>
And then suggest enhancements to the project and Python files by opening issues with the title of your suggestion.<br>
You can also modify the Python files and add a pull request to your issue if you want, and I'll check your issue.<br>
You can now translate my modules, translate them by adding the ISO 639-1 language code to the "Texts.json" of the module you want to translate.<br>
You can find more explanation about how to translate and how the "Language" class works in [this commit](https://github.com/Stake2/Python/commit/adc667c86df4280fdb7867307b240dd15366cac4).<br>
Each module also has a "Descriptions.json" file on its root folder, I ask you to translate the descriptions of the module you are translating.
