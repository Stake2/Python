## Code
Contribute to the project by looking, analyzing, and running the Python files, understanding how the modules work.<br>
And then suggest enhancements to the project and Python files by opening issues with the title of your suggestion.<br>
You can also modify the Python files and add a pull request to your issue if you want, and I'll check your issue.<br>

## Translating
You can now translate my modules, translate them by adding the ISO 639-1 language code to the "Texts.json" of the module you want to translate.<br>
Soon I will make a module on the root folder called "Translator_Helper.py", to help you translate my modules to your language.<br>
Allowing you to choose your native language or the language you know, to translate to, choose a module to translate, and show all of the English texts for you to translate.<br>
For you to translate my modules, you need to know English first, to understand the English texts of the modules and translate them.<br>
<br>
You can find more explanation about how to translate and how the "Language" class works in the [Translating](https://github.com/Stake2/Python/blob/main/TRANSLATING.md) file.<br>
Each module also has a "Descriptions.json" file on its root folder, I ask you to translate the descriptions of the module you are translating.
